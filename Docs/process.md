# Team Process

## Team Organization

Our team was organized into clear roles to enhance collaboration and efficiency:

* Product Owner: Responsible for defining the vision, prioritizing the product backlog, and representing stakeholders' interests.
* Scrum Master: Facilitated meetings, removed impediments, and ensured that the team adhered to agile principles.
* Developers: Each developer focused on specific areas of the application (e.g., frontend, backend, database) while also collaborating on shared components.
* Quality Assurance (QA): Dedicated to testing features, ensuring they meet acceptance criteria and maintaining overall product quality.
We used tools like Trello for task management, Discord for communication, and GitHub for version control.

## Decision Making
Decisions within the team were made collaboratively. We utilized the following approaches:

* Consensus Building: Most decisions were reached through open discussions during meetings, where everyone had the opportunity to share their opinions.
* Voting: For major decisions, we would often conduct a quick vote. This helped us gauge the team’s preference and move forward with majority support.

## Prioritizing User Stories
User stories were prioritized based on a combination of factors:

* Business Value: Stories that aligned closely with our project goals or provided significant value to users were prioritized higher.
* Effort Estimation: We estimated effort using a scale of Easy, Medium, and Hard, considering both complexity and time required.

## Meetings
Our team followed a structured meeting schedule:

* Weekly Stand-ups: We held scheduled meetings every morning to discuss progress, plans for the day, and any blockers.
* Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, we gathered to define goals, select user stories, and estimate efforts.
* Retrospectives: At the end of each sprint, we reflected on what went well, what didn’t, and how we could improve.

## Next Phase
As we move into the next phase, we recognize the strengths in our current processes and the collaborative spirit that has served us well. Here are key areas where we excelled and should continue our efforts:

* Effective Communication: Our daily stand-ups and structured meetings have fostered transparency and collaboration. Maintaining this level of communication will ensure that everyone remains aligned and engaged.
* Team Collaboration: The roles we defined allowed us to leverage each team member's strengths effectively. Continuing to work within this structure will help us maintain our momentum and productivity.
