DealHeaven differentiates itself by its competitors by combining all the
necessary features into one place as a car hub. Customers would not need
to go through many different websites, use different systems, calculate
prices with interest rate. Dealheaven combines car and accessory buying,
selling, renting into a single platform leaving customers less confused
and help them with any decision they decide to take. This website
emphasizes on a direct user interaction through a peer to peer
communication system while our competitors focus more on their vehicles
and addresses to meet up, with limited support for accessory sales and
auctions.

Dealheaven will cater to car enthusiast: customers looking to buy, sell,
or trade not only cars but also accessories and parts. As well as casual
sellers and renters looking to get the most information and best value
for their car.

Our best guess to why our competitors didn't focus on these users nor
scenarios is because, car enthusiast makes up a very small percentage
users using their sites. Casual buyers and sellers are more welcomed
since they wouldn't be selling rare or niche cars. Casual buyers
wouldn't be in the market for exotic cars, or cars that seem important
to enthusiast.
