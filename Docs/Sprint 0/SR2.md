## Retrospective Analysis

### What Went Well:
- **Feature Completion**: All user stories (cost, mileage, and seat capacity filters) were successfully implemented, and the filtering functionality is now fully operational.
- **Collaboration**: The team worked well together, especially in integrating the frontend with the backend and resolving issues during implementation.
- **Task Distribution**: Tasks were distributed according to team members' strengths, which contributed to a smooth workflow.

### What Didnâ€™t Go Well:
- **Testing Coverage**: While the core features were developed, some edge cases, particularly in the seat capacity filter, were missed, which caused minor issues during testing.
- **Time Management**: Time estimates were slightly off, and we could have better allocated time for finalizing and testing the filters.

## Conclusion

Sprint 2 was productive, successfully delivering the three key filtering features. However, to improve future sprints, we need to better manage time and ensure more thorough testing coverage for edge cases.
