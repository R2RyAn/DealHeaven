# Sprint 2 Planning Document - DealHeaven

## Sprint Goal

The goal for Sprint 2 is to implement filtering functionality for car listings based on **cost**, **mileage**, and **seat capacity**. This will enhance the user experience by allowing users to narrow down their search results to match their preferences.

### User Stories to be Completed:
1. **Filter Cars by Cost**: Users will be able to filter cars by a specified price range.
2. **Filter Cars by Mileage**: Users will be able to filter cars based on the mileage range.
3. **Filter Cars by Seat Capacity**: Users will be able to filter cars by the number of seats.

## Participants:
- Ruhullah
- Masooma
- Rayan

### Meeting Date:
- November 17, 2024

## Sprint Breakdown:

### User Stories:
1. **Filter Cars by Cost** (3 Story Points)
   - **Tasks**:
     - **Design the UI element** for the cost filter (e.g., a price range slider, two input fields for "Min" and "Max" price, or a predefined price range dropdown).
     - **Implement the cost filter UI** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
     - **Modify or create an API endpoint** to accept cost filter parameters.
     - **Integrate the frontend cost filter** with the backend API to display filtered results.

2. **Filter Cars by Mileage** (3 Story Points)
   - **Tasks**:
     - **Design the UI element** for the mileage filter (e.g., a slider, input fields for "Min" and "Max" mileage, or a dropdown with predefined ranges).
     - **Implement the mileage filter UI** on the search results page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
     - **Create or modify an API endpoint** to receive and process mileage filter parameters.
     - **Integrate the frontend and backend** so the mileage filter displays results based on user input.

3. **Filter Cars by Seat Capacity** (3 Story Points)
   - **Tasks**:
     - **Design the UI element** for the seat capacity filter (e.g., a dropdown or slider to select the number of seats, or input fields for a minimum and maximum seat range).
     - **Implement the seat capacity filter UI** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
     - **Create or modify an API endpoint** to accept seat capacity filter parameters.
     - **Ensure the frontend filter** works properly with the backend logic to display the correct results.

### Total Story Points for Sprint 2: 9

---

## Decisions Made:
- The focus for Sprint 2 is on implementing the three filtering features (by cost, mileage, and seat capacity).
- No additional spikes or unknowns have been identified for this sprint.
- We will prioritize testing for edge cases to ensure filtering works under different scenarios (e.g., no results found, incorrect input).

## Conclusion

Sprint 2 will focus on delivering the filtering functionality, with a clear breakdown of tasks for each user story. The team is aligned on the sprint goal, and capacity has been reviewed to ensure that the workload is manageable.
